<p>Here are some things that are NOT backups. Feel free to tweet or Facebook them to shame educate your family.
# Backing up your laptop to an SD Card in the same laptop is #notabackup
# Backing up to a hard drive that is 6 inches away from your computer is #notabackup
# Backing up your Gmail to another Gmail account is #notabackup
# Backing up your book by copying it to another folder is #notabackup
# The photos that are still in your camera memory are #notabackup
<p>'''The Backup Rule of Three'''
<p>Here's the rule of three. It's a long time computer-person rule of thumb that you can apply to your life now. It's also called the Backup 3-2-1 rule.
* '''3 copies of anything you care about''' - Two isn't enough if it's important.
* '''2 different formats''' - Example: Dropbox+DVDs or Hard Drive+Memory Stick or CD+Crash Plan, or more
* '''1 off-site backup''' - If the house burns down, how will you get your memories back?
<p>'''Why so paranoid?'''
<p>Simple. Because I care about my work, photos and data and I would be sad if I lost it.
<p>Think about all the times you've heard about a friend who has lost everything. A decade of photos. Years of email. It hurts- just like exercise - because it's good for you.
<p>'''What should l do?'''
<p>I think at a minimum folks should do this.
# Have TWO physical backups (hard drive, memory card) with a copy of everything, at least weekly. You can automate this.
# Backup everything that has data that matters. That means phones, too.
# Have a cloud backup storage (CrashPlan, DropBox, SkyDrive, something)
# Don't trust the cloud. I backup my gmail, too.
# Rotate the physical backups between your house and somewhere else. I use the <u>safety deposit box</u>. You can use your Mama's house. Just label one "Backup A" and one "Backup B" and when you visit, swap them.`],
