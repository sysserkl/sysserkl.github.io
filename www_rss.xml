<item><title>A man bet $50,000 that someone would streak at the Super Bowl — then did it himself. He claimed he cashed out $374,000 and walked away with a $1,000 fine. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/entertainment/super-bowl-streaker-bet-voided-bovada</link></item>
<item><title>A TV reporter in the Philippines brought her puppy to the studio because no one was home to watch him. During the live broadcast of TV Patrol Southern Mindanao, she kept the sleeping puppy hidden at her feet — with only her upper half visible on camera. Behind-the-scenes photos later surfaced and went viral, showing the little golden pup curled up on the studio floor while she delivered the news without missing a beat. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/entertainment/philippines-tv-reporter-hid-puppy-during-broadcast</link></item>
<item><title>In 2012, Walmart ran a Facebook contest to send Pitbull to the store with the most votes. The internet hijacked it and voted for a tiny Walmart in Kodiak, Alaska — a remote island only reachable by plane or boat. Everyone expected him to back out. He didn’t. He flew to Alaska, performed for the whole town, took photos with fans, and called it &amp;quot;the greatest thing ever.&amp;quot; - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/entertainment/pitbull-walmart-kodiak-alaska-internet-prank</link></item>

<item><title>Your cornea has no blood supply at all — it gets its oxygen directly from the air, dissolved through your tears. It&amp;#39;s one of the only tissues in the human body that is completely avascular. This is also why wearing contact lenses for too long can cause problems: they block oxygen from reaching the cornea. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/body/cornea-no-blood-supply-oxygen-from-air</link></item>
<item><title>The human liver can regenerate to its full size from as little as 25% of its original tissue. It&amp;#39;s the only internal organ that can do this — which is why living-donor liver transplants work. Surgeons remove up to 60% of the donor&amp;#39;s liver, transplant it, and both the donor and recipient end up with full-sized livers within months. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/body/liver-regeneration-from-25-percent</link></item>
<item><title>In 1997, a 23-year-old French con artist convinced a Texas family he was their missing teenage son — despite having brown eyes instead of blue, a heavy French accent, and being a completely different person. He lived with them for months before a private investigator uncovered the truth. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/people/frederic-bourdin-the-chameleon</link></item>

<item><title>The town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, has been on fire since 1962. An underground coal seam ignited, creating sinkholes that vent toxic gas, forcing nearly everyone to leave. The fire still burns today and could continue for 250 more years. - Fun Facts</title><link>https://funfactz.com/places/centralia-pennsylvania-underground-fire-burning-since-1962</link></item>
